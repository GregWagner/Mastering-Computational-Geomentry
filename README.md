# Jyamithika
## _Collection of Computational Geometry algorithms and simulations_

Jyamithika is a collection of algorithms, sample simulations, utilities which is intend for anyone who wants to learn computational geometry.
Following are the major topics implemented
- Algorithms for prmitive testing for intersection and distance queries in 2D and 3D geometry.
- Convexhull algorithms in both 2D and 3D
- Spatial partition data structures like BSP, KD Tree, Range Tree, Quad Tree and related algorithms.
- Polygon triangulation probelm.
- Trazpezoid map creation.
- Robot motion planing related data structures and algorithms.
- Linear programming.
- Collision detection queries.
- Voronoi Diagrams
- Simplex range searching

## Simulations

I have added set of simulations for demonstration purposes. These simulations use the algorithms implemented in the library.
